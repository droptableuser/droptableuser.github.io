I finally came around and did some work on this site and related services.

* switched the TLS certificates to Let's Encrypt and up'd the key length
* HTTPS is now served over HTTP2
{% highlight nginx %}
server {
    listen 		443 ssl http2;
    listen              [::]:443 ssl http2 default;
}
{% endhighlight %}
* as seen on this snippet I finally made it to IPv6 land
* improved keyexchange protocols on ECDH. This leads to same security as 7168-bit RSA.
{% highlight nginx %}
...
    ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
