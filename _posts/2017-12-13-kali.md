Since I now installed the second Kali in a row, this should be remembered at some point to do, since GNOME is way to ressource hungry.

{% highlight bash %}
apt update
apt uprade
apt install -y kali-defaults kali-root-login desktop-base xfce4 xfce4-places-plugin xfce4-goodies virtualbox-guest-x11
update-alternatives --config x-session-manager
reboot
{% endhighlight %}
