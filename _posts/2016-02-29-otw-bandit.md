For some time now I looked for a time off activity and last Saturday I settled on doing some wargames. I quick search came up with [overthwire.org](http://overthewire.org).

They have a decent beginners game called bandit.

It took me, with no wargame experience but some decent Linux/bash skills about an hour to burn through 25 of the 26 levels.

The last level was quite a challenge. I had the right approach mapped out, but tried to achieve it with the wrong mechanisms. I finished this level the next day. In all it took me 2 hours of reading man pages.

I can only recommend this to everyone. This is also a great way to learn some Linux and bash things on the way.

I refrain from posting solutions, that would take the fun out of it. So go and try it out yourself.

Just log into **bandit.labs.overthewire.org* with username **bandit0** and password **bandit0**. Hints start at [Bandit 0](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html). you mostly need man pages if you are unsure about stuff.

If you know of a cool wargame hit me up on Twitter.
