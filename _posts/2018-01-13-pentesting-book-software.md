Upon starting to work through [Penetration Testing](https://nostarch.com/pentesting) by [Georgia Weidman](http://bulbsecurity.com/about/), I decided to run on an up-to-date software stack.
When installing with a current [Kali Linux](http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2017.3/kali-linux-2017.3-amd64.iso) some some software packages differ from what is in the book.
# Nessus
This comes now in version [7.0.1](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/)
# The Ming C Compiler
The 32bit only compiler has been dropped in favor of the 32/64bit cross compiler
{% highlight bash %}
apt install mingw-w64
{% endhighlight %}
#  Hyperion
This has been update to [1.2](https://github.com/nullsecuritynet/tools/raw/master/binary/hyperion/release/Hyperion-1.2.zip) and the 1.0 Version is not available anymore with the provided link.
{% highlight bash %}
wget https://github.com/nullsecuritynet/tools/raw/master/binary/hyperion/release/Hyperion-1.2.zip
unzip Hyperion-1.2.zip
i686-w64-mingw32-c++-win32 Hyperion-1.2/Src/Crypter/*.cpp -o hyperion.exe
{% endhighlight %}
# Android SDK
The Android SDK download is now bundle with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). After downloading Android Studio and unzipping it, run the setup wizard
{% highlight bash %}
unzip android-studio-ide-171.4443003-linux.zip
./android-studio/bin/studio.sh 
{% endhighlight %}
This will install the Android SDK under ```~/Android/Sdk```. Create a sample project from the wizard. After the IDE loads you can now open the SDK Manager. To open the SDK Manager from Android Studio, click ```Tools > Android > SDK Manager``` or click ```SDK Manager```  in the toolbar. 
Install the Android versions of mentioned in the book. 

Open the ```AVD Manager``` by clicking ```Tools > Android > AVD Manager```. 
1. Click ```+ Create Virtual Device...```. 
2. On  the next window select ```Phone``` and ```Nexus 4```.
3. Click Next
4. Select ```Other Images```. Download ```Jelly Bean``` with ABI ```armeabi-v7a```.
4. Click Next. Click Finish
Repeat for the other two Android APIs from the book.
