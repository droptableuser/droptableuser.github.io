I sadly forgot where I found this snippet, but it lists your most used commands in the shell. 

{% highlight bash %}
history | \
  awk 'BEGIN {FS="[ \t]+|\\|"} {print $3}' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nr | \
  less
{% endhighlight %}

Wonder how accurately this could be used to identify users on a shared server...
