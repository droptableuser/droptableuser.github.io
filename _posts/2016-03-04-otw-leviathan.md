I finished [Leviathan](http://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/)

This is a 7 level wargame. The level which challenged me the most was level 2. Overall it took me about 2.5 hours to finish it.

It is a little bit harder than bandit, but it uses a lot of the same mechanics.
The main difference is that there are no hints posted on the website. This makes
it just a little bit harder.

A thing that helped me through a few levels was [ltrace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ltrace.1.html)

I refrain from posting solutions, that would take the fun out of it. So go and try it out yourself.

Just log into **leviathan.labs.overthewire.org** with username **leviathan0** and
password **leviathan0**.

If you know of a cool wargame hit me up on Twitter.
